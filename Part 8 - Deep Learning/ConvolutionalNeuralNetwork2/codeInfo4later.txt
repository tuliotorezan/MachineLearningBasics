this exemple uses the fashionMNIST dataset, which basically copies the original MNIST dataset (numbers from 0-9) because (taken from their git repository)


"MNIST is too easy. Convolutional nets can achieve 99.7% on MNIST. Classic machine learning algorithms can also achieve 97% easily. Check out our side-by-side benchmark for Fashion-MNIST vs. MNIST, and read "Most pairs of MNIST digits can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel."

MNIST is overused. In this April 2017 Twitter thread, Google Brain research scientist and deep learning expert Ian Goodfellow calls for people to move away from MNIST.

MNIST can not represent modern CV tasks, as noted in this April 2017 Twitter thread, deep learning expert/Keras author Fran√ßois Chollet."

The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging between 0 and 255. The labels are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9.
